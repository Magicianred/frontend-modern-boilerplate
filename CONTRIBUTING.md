# Contributing to Transcriptase
I love your input and I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## I Develop with Github
I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
